1 Radius for matching peaks from frame to frame: 
	In the XML file, there is an option matching peaks from frame to frame, which shouldn't be zero. 
	Even though the radius don't need changed frequently, it's better to be set as 0.7. 
2 Gen warm bead: 
	arg1 is correct. but some variables are not, for example: 
	acq_path = 'Z:/Jackie/neuroD6_retina_round2_section10_3/acquisition/'
3 Even though not tested yet: 
	In XY alignment files: 
	line: 
	im = Image.open((ISanalysisfolder + "%04d" % i + "\\rawimages\\647Conv_" + "%02d" % i + ".tif"))
	The "%02d" might need to be changed to "%03d" when the image filenames have 3 digits. There are 5 such lines need to be changed. 

ADD XML FILE FOR LoadAFrame Parametrization for XYAlign and BeadProcessing 


CRITICAL THINGS TO DO 

Thursday
- Xy_align - integrate Jerry's code for this as well! 
- Change the numbers so that its less than 12 and then run it (hopefully it works) --> CHECK (done) --> Need to revert eventually
- Port crop_datastack and wga_norm_and_thresh to python 
- Run z-align with proper xy-align from Colenso's folder 
--------------------------------------------------------------

DONE!
4. FRAME ISSUE 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 837, in handleFrameSpinBox
    self.displayFrame(False)
  File "main.py", line 691, in displayFrame
    frame = self.movie_file.loadAFrame(self.cur_frame).astype(numpy.float)
  File "C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\storm_analysis\sa_library\datareader.py", line 237, in loadAFrame
    super(DaxReader, self).loadAFrame(frame_number)
  File "C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\storm_analysis\sa_library\datareader.py", line 144, in loadAFrame
    assert frame_number < self.number_frames, "Frame number must be less than " + str(self.number_frames)
AssertionError: Frame number must be less than 8000

 mainV2 is working fine so need to fix that! 

Add scaling subwindow for automatic rescaling to README 



Add a setup.py to install all of the dependencies
Add miniconda 
Give instructions and then send that out later tonight
